   # Everything you need to know about Electrochemistry.
</span>






<span style="color:white;font-size:25px">
Electrochemistry is the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions. There are two ways that electricity and chemical reactions interact: certain chemical reactions can create electricity, and electricity can force certain chemical reactions to happen that wouldn't happen otherwise. We'll look at two very common examples in electrochemistry. We'll see how a galvanic or voltaic cell uses a chemical reaction to create electricity, and we'll see how electrolysis uses electricity to cause water to decompose into hydrogen and oxygen gas. We'll also look at the list of Standard Reduction Potentials, to figure out what chemical reactions will happen on their own (are spontaneous) are can create electricity, and which will not happen on their own (are not spontaneous) and require electricity to happen.
